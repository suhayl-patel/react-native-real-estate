# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

Project structure:

app.json: 
Contains the configuration options for the project, and is called the app config. These options change the behavior of your proejct while you are building, updating or submitting your project.
expo object: route object containing all the app configuration
 - name - project name - homescreen or applist
 - slug - unique id used by expo, used for defining url of your project
 - userInterfaceStyle - light, dark or automatic
 - newArchEnabled - uses newer versions of react native for better performance. Bridgless architecture. Before we needed a bridge between JS and native mobile app code. This led to issues. New architecture react native allows communication without the bridge and removes performance issues.



package.json: 
This file contains the project dependencies, scripts, metadata

tsconfig.json:
This file contains the rules that typescript will use to ensure typesafety throughout the project 

.gitignore:
files which are ignored

app folder:
routing functionality similar to Next.JS. There is a tabs group which has more files.
